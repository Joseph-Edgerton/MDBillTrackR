Authors@R: person('Joseph', 'Edgerton', email = 'jedgerton@umces.edu', role = c('cre', 'aut'))
Description: This dashboard will update each hour to add new Maryland legislature bills to its internal SQlite database.
  For each hour, the incoming bills can be filtered by keywords to reduce manual searching. Filtered bills can be tracked and
  then updated with current information. Other analytics, such as legislative session progress, will be displayed as well.
